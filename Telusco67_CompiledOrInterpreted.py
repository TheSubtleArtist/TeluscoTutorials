'''
Compiled Language:
-The program, once compiled, is expressed in the instructions of the target machine
-This machine code is undecipherable by humans.
-Types of compiled language – C, C++, C#, CLEO, COBOL, etc.
-they tend to be faster and more efficient
-give the developer more control over hardware aspects, like memory management and CPU usage
-You need to “rebuild” the program every time you need to make a change.
-Not portable

Interpreted Language:
-Interpreted, without compiling a program into machine instructions.
-It is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine
-Read and executed by some other program (virtual machine, run-time envionrment).
-once significantly slower than compiled languages. But, with the development of just-in-time compilation, that gap is shrinking.
-Interpreted language ranges – JavaScript, Perl, Python, BASIC, etc.

Caveats
-Most programming languages can have both compiled and interpreted implementations
-the language itself is not necessarily compiled or interpreted.
-However, for simplicity’s sake, they’re typically referred to as such.

Python
Coding --> Compiled into byte code to achieve portability --> interpretation by virtual machine --> executed in machine langauge
PVM - Python Virtual Machine
virtual machies tend to be specific to the language

CPYTHON / JPython / IRONPYTHON / PyPy
-implementations of python, based on the architecutre of the machine whre the virtual machine communicates
